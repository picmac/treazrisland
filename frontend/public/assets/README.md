# Public Asset Inventory

This directory contains curated static assets that can be safely shipped with the TREAZRISLAND frontend. Each subfolder mirrors the creative asset taxonomy described in [`docs/brand/hero-art-guidelines.md`](../../../docs/brand/hero-art-guidelines.md).

## Hero art

- `hero/placeholder-hero.svg` – Accessible fallback artwork surfaced whenever curated hero art has not been uploaded yet. The palette matches the lagoon, kelp, and coral color tokens defined in `tailwind.config.ts` so that UI chrome and hero imagery stay consistent.

When adding production art, follow the sourcing rules below and keep the placeholder in place for automated tests.
