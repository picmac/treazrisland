# 2024-07-18 Playtest Script Dry Run

## Schedule Details

- **Window**: 2024-07-18 @ 10:00–11:00 PT
- **Format**: Remote via staging build (v0.4.2) and shared Zoom room
- **Participants**: Admin Facilitator (A. Vega), Session Lead (M. Torres), Observer (L. Cho), Testers T01–T04
- **Objectives**:
  - Validate the new `/docs/playtest-script.md` instructions end-to-end.
  - Ensure save-state/resume beats are stable before inviting external partners.
  - Confirm observation logging + issue filing workflow is understood by all roles.

## Findings

1. **Admin setup friction**: Creating the `Playtest-2024-07-18` cohort surfaced a missing description field requirement; we added a reminder to the script pre-checklist and filed issue `#712` (P2) to relax validation.
2. **Save-state telemetry delay**: Resume worked, but progress metrics appeared 5 minutes late in the dashboard. Issue `#713` (P1) opened with logs and timestamps from the observation template.
3. **Observation log template clarity**: Testers appreciated the severity guidance. Observer requested an explicit column for "Filed?" status—added manually for this session; pending incorporation into the template backlog.
4. **Issue workflow confirmation**: GitHub template captured steps, but linking to large video files required manual upload. Action item to automate shared-drive links (tracked as `#714`, P2).

## Next Steps

- Update playtest script to reflect additional checklist reminder and ensure note-takers add a "Filed?" column until the template is revised.
- Re-run telemetry verification after the analytics hotfix (ETA 2024-07-22) before scheduling external players.
- Session Lead to post recap in `#mvp-playtest` and confirm P0/P1 ownership in the upcoming triage.
