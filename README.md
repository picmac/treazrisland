# TREAZRISLAND

TREAZRISLAND is a self-hosted retro gaming portal that blends a Fastify backend, a Next.js 19 frontend, and SNES-inspired artwork. This repository also contains documentation and infrastructure helpers required to run the stack locally or on a home server.

## Architecture overview

| Layer      | Location          | Summary |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Backend    | `backend/`        | Fastify + Prisma service providing authentication, library management, ROM delivery, and save-state APIs. |
| Frontend   | `frontend/`       | Next.js App Router experience that consumes the backend APIs and renders EmulatorJS locally. |
| Infra      | `infra/`          | Docker Compose definitions and deployment scripts for local and production-like hosting. |
| Docs       | `docs/`           | Product, security, testing, and operations guides referenced throughout the codebase. |

Review the [Product Requirements Document](./TREAZRISLAND_PRD.md) and the [Threat Model](./docs/security/threat-model.md) before making changes that affect behaviour or security posture.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS and npm 10 (matching the versions generated by the checked-in lockfiles).
- Docker and Docker Compose v2 for containerised dependencies.
- Git LFS if you plan to version large binary assets.

## Environment configuration

1. Copy the template and keep it as the canonical source of truth for local values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Reuse the same file everywhere by symlinking it into each package (or copying it if you prefer standalone files):

   ```bash
   ln -s ../.env backend/.env
   ln -s ../.env frontend/.env.local
   ```

   The frontend reads only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables; adjust `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` if your backend runs on a non-default
   host/port. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and `STORAGE_ENDPOINT` default to `http://localhost` so the stack works without TLS in
   development.

3. Replace all placeholder secrets before exposing the stack to real users. The most important keys are summarised below:

| Area | Keys | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| JWT & sessions | `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_ACCESS_TTL`, `JWT_REFRESH_TTL` | Use a 32+ character secret in production. TTL values accept [zeit/ms](https://github.com/vercel/ms) format (`15m`, `30d`). |
| Email (Postmark) | `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`, `POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL`, `POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM` | Mandatory when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=postmark`. Disable email features by leaving the provider unset only in development. |
| Storage | `STORAGE_DRIVER`, `STORAGE_*` | Set `STORAGE_DRIVER=filesystem` for a simple local path (`STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOT`). For MinIO/S3, fill `ENDPOINT`, `REGION`, `ACCESS_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, and bucket names. |
| ScreenScraper | `SCREENSCRAPER_*` | Store plaintext credentials in a secret manager. Use `npm run screenscraper:encrypt` (in `backend/`) to produce the encrypted developer ID/password and commit only the encrypted values. |
| Observability | `LOG_LEVEL`, `METRICS_ENABLED`, `METRICS_TOKEN` | Enable metrics and set a token when scraping `/metrics` from Prometheus. |
| Frontend security | `TREAZ_TLS_MODE` | Defaults to `https` so HSTS/`upgrade-insecure-requests` stay enabled. Override to `http` only for localhost development without TLS. |

Backend configuration is validated on boot by [`backend/src/config/env.ts`](./backend/src/config/env.ts). The process exits with a detailed error message if any required key is missing or malformed.

### HTTP defaults and opting into TLS

- The repository now defaults to `TREAZ_TLS_MODE=https`, keeping HSTS and `upgrade-insecure-requests` active so production browsers refuse insecure downgrades.
- For purely local development you can set `TREAZ_TLS_MODE=http` (see `scripts/dev-http.sh`) to disable the HTTPS-only headers while working on `http://localhost` or LAN-only stacks.
  - Point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` at your `https://` hostname.
  - Update `STORAGE_ENDPOINT` to an HTTPS object-store endpoint (or unset it if your S3-compatible provider enforces TLS automatically).
  - Restart the frontend dev server or rebuild the production bundle so the new security headers take effect.
- Leave `TREAZ_DEV_HTTP_AUTOCONFIG=true` (the default) when you opt into HTTP. The helper scripts reuse that flag to rewrite `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_CDN` to a LAN-friendly host when they still point at `localhost`, and they also flip `TREAZ_TLS_MODE` to `http` so browsers do not enforce HTTPS-only headers once those overrides are applied.
- Keep the backend and frontend `.env` files in sync (symlinks or shared `TREAZ_ENV_FILE`) so these values propagate through Docker Compose and helper scripts.

## Local development workflow

You can launch both apps with the HTTP defaults in a single terminal via:

```bash
./scripts/dev-http.sh
```

The helper loads `.env.http` (or `.env`) and starts the backend and frontend with HTTP defaults, printing the
detected URLs for quick access (falling back to `localhost` when no LAN IP can be resolved).

### Testing on another device or self-hosted runner

When you need to reach the dev stack from a phone or another machine on your LAN, the helper binds both
servers to `0.0.0.0` by default and advertises the detected LAN IP when possible. For deterministic URLs set
`TREAZ_DEV_LAN_HOST` in your `.env.http` (or main `.env`) and leave `TREAZ_DEV_HTTP_AUTOCONFIG=true` so both
helper scripts rewrite the public URLs automatically.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.http` (or reuse your main `.env`) and keep `TREAZ_TLS_MODE=http`.
2. (Optional) Pin the LAN identity with environment variables:
   ```bash
   export TREAZ_DEV_LAN_HOST=192.168.50.10
   export DEV_HTTP_BACKEND_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
   export DEV_HTTP_FRONTEND_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
   ```
   `TREAZ_DEV_LAN_HOST` feeds both `scripts/dev-http.sh` and the Docker deployment script. The `DEV_HTTP_*` variables
   are only necessary when you need to bind to a specific interface instead of every address.
3. Start the stack with `./scripts/dev-http.sh`. The script automatically updates `LISTEN_HOST`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`,
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, and storage/CDN URLs when they are still pointing at `localhost`.

On a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner you can skip the helper entirely when using Docker builds: set
`TREAZ_TLS_MODE=http` and (optionally) `TREAZ_DEV_LAN_HOST` in the env file that `TREAZ_ENV_FILE` points to, then run
`scripts/deploy/deploy-local.sh`. The script writes a temporary env file with LAN-aware overrides before calling
`docker compose`, downgrades `TREAZ_TLS_MODE` to `http` when the defaults still point at `localhost`, and the resulting
frontend is reachable at `http://<runner-ip>:3000/` as soon as the workflow finishes without extra manual steps.

1. **Start shared services**

   ```bash
   docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up postgres minio
   ```

   The compose file also defines `backend` and `frontend` services; omit them when you want to run the apps directly on your host.

2. **Install backend dependencies and apply database state**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   npm run prisma:seed:platforms
   npm run dev
   ```

   The dev server listens on `http://localhost:3001` by default. Keep this terminal open so Fastify can hot-reload on changes.

3. **Install frontend dependencies and start the Next.js dev server**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the App Router UI. Authentication flows call the backend using the base URL defined in `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

4. **Optional: run everything via Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

   This command builds the Dockerfiles, loads environment defaults from `.env` (or the file referenced by `TREAZ_ENV_FILE`), and
   launches all services together.

## Quality gates

Follow the [Testing Strategy](./docs/testing/README.md) before opening a pull request. In brief:

- `npm run lint` and `npm test` in both `backend/` and `frontend/`.
- `npm run build` in each package to ensure production bundles compile.
- Optional Playwright smoke tests: `RUN_SMOKE_E2E=1 npm run test:e2e:smoke` from `frontend/` after the stack is running.
